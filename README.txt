This repo holds files containing scripts for creating Apple Workflows that can be used with keyboard shortcuts globally on a Mac.

Once you have created the Workflow in Automator, you can add them to the 	`~/Library/Services` folder. Once you've done this, you can go to your system keyboard setup, then under the `Shortcuts` tab, select 'Services'. Your new 'service should then show up near the bottom of the list under 'General'.
