This repo holds files containing scripts for creating Apple Workflows that can be used with keyboard shortcuts globally on a Mac.

Once you have created the Workflow in Automator, you can add them to the `~/Library/Services` folder. Pending your preferences you selected in Automator for 'Service Receives' and 'in', you should then be able to go to your system keyboard setup, then under the 'Shortcuts' tab, select 'Services'. Your new service should then show up near the bottom of the list under 'General'. If your service is not showing up, it's likely due to your selection of what the service receives and in what 'application' it receives it. If you want it to always be available, select Service Receives 'no input' in 'any application'.
